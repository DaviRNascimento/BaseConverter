# BaseConverter
Base Converter Calculator!

This is a Base Converter i made by myself, as a personal Project. I started to learn JS and joining my html and css knowledge, this is the result. Id like to improve it more while I learn
and I think this is an useful project, helping me in my college studies;

About the code:
HTML
I tried to do a simple HTML code, just with some inputs and a navbar. it has a brand and an icon, taken from bootstrap icons, and 4 links pointed to pages Id like to add futurally;
the inputs are grouped together in an input group, an idea i had to organize and manipulate this better. Of course i was able to do it in varoious ways, cause nowadays html with a css library
are almost a programming language, but after think a little, i choosed this layout. One of the advantages of use Bootstrap is it's facility to make responsive designs, and so did I.
just some 'commands' and it was responsive, organized and now sounds comfortable in every screen size.

JAVASCRIPT
This js script was not so hard to develop, I would say. The major problems were the conditional to only output the conversions if the base number were structuraly correct. For example, the 
function to convert from binary first check if the number string is all formed by binary digits, 0's and 1's, and then convert. I felt happy and proud because for the first time i really needed
to use a regular epression inside the script and I could understand how to use this.

In a nutshell, this is one of my first Projects and below you can check my email and linkedin:
